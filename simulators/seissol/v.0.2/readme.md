# SeisSol Simulator

**SeisSol** is a state-of-the-art software package designed for simulating seismic wave propagation and earthquake dynamics. It leverages high-performance computational techniques to solve complex partial differential equations for various physical models, such as elastic, viscoelastic, poroelastic, and anisotropic materials. SeisSol is optimized for distributed (MPI) and shared memory (OpenMP) parallel architectures, enabling efficient large-scale seismic simulations.

## Binaries Generated by SeisSol

When you compile SeisSol, multiple binaries are generated, each serving a different purpose:

1. **Main Simulation Executable**:
   - **`SeisSol_release_*`**: This is the primary binary used for running seismic simulations. It takes input parameter files that specify the simulation settings, initial conditions, and material properties.

   - **For This Container**: The binary is located in **`SeisSol/build`**.

2. **Proxy Applications**:
   - **`SeisSol_proxy_*`**: These binaries are specialized for benchmarking and testing specific computational kernels used in SeisSol. They help evaluate the performance characteristics of certain modules without running a full simulation.

3. **Utilities**:
   - **Mesh Converters**: Tools to convert mesh data to the format required by SeisSol.
   - **Pre-processing Scripts**: Scripts to prepare input data such as initial conditions, source models, and material configurations.

## Supported Equations

SeisSol can simulate the following physical models, each requiring a different compilation:

1. **Elastic** (`-DEQUATIONS=elastic`):
   - Models elastic wave propagation in homogeneous or heterogeneous media.

2. **Viscoelastic** (`-DEQUATIONS=viscoelastic`):
   - Simulates wave propagation in materials with viscous damping effects.

3. **Poroelastic** (`-DEQUATIONS=poroelastic`):
   - Models fluid-saturated porous materials, capturing the interaction between solid and fluid phases.

4. **Anisotropic** (`-DEQUATIONS=anisotropic`):
   - Simulates wave propagation in materials with direction-dependent properties, such as crystals or layered media.

## Compilation and Simulation Flexibility

### One-Time Compilation vs. Multiple Compilations

SeisSol is highly configurable, allowing for either a one-time compilation to run various simulations or multiple compilations based on specific simulation requirements.

#### **One-Time Compilation for Multiple Simulations**

- **Parameter-Driven Configurations**: SeisSol supports input parameter files that allow you to modify mesh data, initial conditions, material properties, and other simulation settings.
- **Flexible Simulation Setup**: With a single compiled binary, you can run different simulations by simply changing the input files, making it suitable for users needing multiple runs with varying scenarios.

- **Precompiled Binaries for Different Configurations**: It is also possible to have different combinations of precompiled binaries in the build directory (e.g., for elastic, viscoelastic, poroelastic, anisotropic) to avoid recompiling each time a different model is needed.

#### **Recompilation for Different Configurations**

In some cases, recompiling SeisSol is necessary to optimize performance or change core capabilities:

1. **Different Physical Models**:
   - SeisSol can simulate **elastic**, **viscoelastic**, **poroelastic**, and **anisotropic** material behaviors.
   - Each physical model requires different equations to be solved, which can lead to changes in the generated code and data structures.
   - To support these models, you need to recompile SeisSol with specific options, such as `-DEQUATIONS=elastic`, `-DEQUATIONS=viscoelastic`, etc.

2. **Order of Accuracy**:
   - The spatial and temporal accuracy is controlled by the **order of accuracy** (`-DORDER` flag).
   - To increase accuracy, you need to recompile the binary with a different order, which affects performance and memory usage.

3. **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**:
   - SeisSol supports hardware-specific optimizations, like using **LIBXSMM**, **MKL**, or **OpenBLAS** for matrix operations.
   - Changing the optimization strategy requires recompiling to tailor the binary for your specific hardware setup.

4. **Feature Flags**:
   - Certain features such as **ASAGI** (for spatial datasets) or **EASI** (for complex material parameterizations) are compile-time options.
   - Enabling or disabling these features (`-DASAGI=ON/OFF`, `-DEASI=ON/OFF`) requires recompilation to include the appropriate components.

### Practical Considerations

- **Separate Binaries for Different Models**: You can maintain separate binaries for different physical models (e.g., `SeisSol_release_elastic`, `SeisSol_release_viscoelastic`) to easily switch between models without recompiling.
- **Compilation Scripts**: Use scripts to automate the compilation process for different configurations, ensuring consistency and ease of use.
- **Documentation**: Maintain a clear record of compile-time options used for each binary to facilitate reproducibility and collaboration.

### Summary

- **One-Time Compilation**: Use parameter files to adjust simulation settings without recompiling.
- **Multiple Compilations**: Required for changing the physical model, accuracy order, hardware optimizations, or enabling/disabling specific features.

This flexibility allows SeisSol to be used for a wide range of scenarios, from basic elastic simulations to complex earthquake dynamics involving poroelastic and anisotropic materials.
